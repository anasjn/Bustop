Aplicación nativa ANDROID para la localización de autobuses más frecuentemente
usados en Londres

Proposal
--------------------

There are different apps in the Android market which provide the users with
different sort of information around the buses in London,
like "Live London Bus Tracker" or "Bus London - Times and routes". These apps
provide with detailed information about routes, schedules or trip planning, but are not focused on users routines despite they used mainly
the same routes.This app aim to cover this gap by providing
a specific type of users who use regulary one or various bus lines in specific bus
stops and who needs to know quickly, reliable and in real time
the answer to the question: "What time is the next bus to...?"

The objective of this PFC is to develop an Android native app for the localization
of buses in London. It will have a simple interface in which
the user will be able to configure alerts based on the bus line and the bus stop of
his preference, showing the info based on his location, in
real time and with no need of interaction.

The project will be elaborate following an agile approach in order to facilitate a
progressive development and integration of the product,
looking for a better interaction with the customer which will help to produce a
product that fits better to his needs. I will also
prioritize the use of Open Source tools for the management and the development
of the app.

For the implemantation the following technologies and tools have been identified:
+ Java and XML.
+ "Transport For London Unified API" for the functional core of the app (it provides
all the information from all the public transport in a RESTful API)
+ GIT as repository and version control.
+ Android Studio as IDE.
+ Agile project management tool. Opensource alternative to Jira.
